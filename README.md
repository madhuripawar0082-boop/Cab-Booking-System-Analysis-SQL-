🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset contains cab booking transaction records with the following fields:
•	Booking ID
•	Customer ID
•	Driver ID
•	Pickup Location
•	Drop Location
•	Booking Date
•	Booking Time
•	Trip Distance

🧹 Data Cleaning (Using SQL)
•	Removed duplicate booking records
•	Handled missing values using NULL checks
•	Standardized date and time formats
•	Corrected inconsistent location names
•	Converted columns to appropriate data types

📊 SQL Analysis Performed
The following types of queries were written:
•	Total number of bookings
•	Total completed and cancelled trips
•	Total revenue generated
•	Average trip distance and fare
•	Peak booking hours
•	Top pickup and drop locations
•	Customer-wise trip count
•	Driver-wise trip performance
•	Payment mode usage

🔍 Key Insights
•	Most bookings occur during morning and evening peak hours
•	City center locations have the highest demand
•	Online payments are more common than cash
•	A small number of customers generate a large share of bookings
•	Cancellations are higher during late-night hours
